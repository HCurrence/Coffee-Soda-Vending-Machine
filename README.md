# Coffee-Soda-Vending-Machine

This idea was pitched at the Charlotte Venture Challenge at UNC Charlotte.

I designed the exterior and interior mechanics of my idea for a voice-activated cold and hot drink dispenser. 
This repo is currently missing my original designs; however, everything concerning the pitch and the materials explaining my idea are here.
